# GCP-1
Use Go Code to Work with Google Cloud Data Sources

## Project 
- Create a Firestore database and initialize App Engine
- Code review of the open source tool developed by Google
- Explore code patterns that extract data from Google Cloud
- Test your Go app from a browser
- Deploy your Go app to App Engine
- Test your deployed Go app from a browser or using curl commands
 
### APP Engine
> App Engine is a serverless compute platform that is fully managed to scale up and down as workloads demand. Go apps running on App Engine give you the best of the cloud by being extremely efficient with CPU and memory resources at cloud scale with the App Engine service.

- Go apps are compiled to a single binary executable file during the deployment
- Cold Start (zero instances running) request initial response times are often between 80 and 1400 milliseconds
- Hot (at least 1 instance running ) requests are fulfilled immediately.
